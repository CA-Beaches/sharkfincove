# Beach

Shark Fin Cove boasts a beautiful secluded beach right off Highway 1. After you climb/walk down the path to the beach entry, you will have ~140 yards of open beach area with enough space for picnics, sports, and social distancing. As you get closer to the water, you can hang out on the right side (which is hidden from the view of the enterance) or relax on the left side cove overhang.
