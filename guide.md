## Accessing the Beach

The beach at Shark Fin Cove is not easy to access. There is a narrow path leading from the parking lot down to the beach. There are no handrails, wheelchair ramps, nor any other tools to enable easy access to the beach. See the image below for a snapshot of what it looks like to get down to the beach. We suggest you proceed with caution (especially given that you cannot socially distance while in this section of the park).
